I have a mac book. I want to recreate assembly from the ground up to truly learn how to make a programming language. Please be my guide, work out the overall process to do this

Love this — excellent project. Recreating “assembly from the ground up” is one of the fastest, most illuminating ways to learn how languages, compilers, linkers, and hardware fit together. I’ll act as your guide and give a practical, hands-on roadmap you can run on your MacBook, with concrete milestones, example ISA (so you can start now), implementation notes, and suggested next steps.

I’ll assume you want to design an instruction set, write an assembler that turns human text into machine bytes, write an emulator/simulator that executes those bytes, then optionally build a linker/loader and a tiny compiler front-end that emits your assembly. I’ll keep recommendations pragmatic: use Python for quick iteration and C or Rust when performance matters.

⸻

Big picture roadmap (high level)
	1.	Foundations (short) — learn binary, bytes, two’s complement, CPU basics (registers, PC, flags), calling conventions.
	2.	Design an ISA (small, toy) — registers, instruction formats, addressing modes, encodings.
	3.	Write an assembler — tokenizer, parser, symbol table, output machine code (object files).
	4.	Write an emulator (CPU simulator) — fetch-decode-execute loop for your ISA.
	5.	Add features — labels, data directives, macros, expressions, relocations, multiple object files + linker.
	6.	Build tooling & tests — disassembler, debugger, test harness.
	7.	Write a tiny compiler — generate your assembly from a tiny subset of a language (expressions, functions, conditionals).
	8.	Advanced — port toolchain to real executable formats (ELF or Mach-O), or target real hardware/VM/LLVM.

⸻

Tools & languages (what to use on your Mac)
	•	Start in Python: assembler and emulator — fast to write and iterate.
	•	Move to C or Rust: for a higher-performance emulator or linker.
	•	Optional: learn LLVM later if you want a real compiler backend.
	•	Keep git for version control. Use editors you like (VSCode, Vim).
	•	For reference and comparison: clang, ld, objdump, nasm — inspect real tool outputs.

⸻

Phase 1 — Foundations (1–2 days)
	•	Refresh on binary, hex, two’s complement, bit masking, byte order (endianness).
	•	Read about CPU concepts: registers, PC, stack, calling conventions, interrupts.
	•	Small exercises: manually encode numbers/negative numbers into bytes; write bitwise operations in Python.

⸻

Phase 2 — Design a minimal ISA (immediate — start now)

Design a tiny, clear instruction set you will use throughout. Here’s a concrete example you can implement immediately.

Example toy ISA (16-bit words, byte-addressable memory)
	•	Registers: R0..R7 (8 general-purpose), PC, SP, FLAGS
	•	Word size: 16 bits
	•	Memory: simple byte array (e.g., 64KB)
	•	Instruction format: 16-bit instruction words, optionally followed by immediate or address words.
	•	Opcode layout (example):
	•	Bits 15..12: opcode (4 bits → 16 opcodes)
	•	Bits 11..9: reg A (3 bits)
	•	Bits 8..6: reg B (3 bits)
	•	Bits 5..0: mode/imm/flags (6 bits) — interpretation depends on opcode

Minimal opcode set (conceptual)
	•	0000 NOP
	•	0001 MOV regA, regB        ; regA = regB
	•	0010 LOADI regA, imm16     ; regA = immediate (follows instruction)
	•	0011 ADD regA, regB        ; regA += regB
	•	0100 SUB regA, regB        ; regA -= regB
	•	0101 JMP addr16            ; PC = addr16
	•	0110 JZ addr16             ; if zero flag then PC = addr16
	•	0111 CALL addr16           ; push PC; PC = addr16
	•	1000 RET                   ; pop PC
	•	1001 LOAD regA, addr16     ; regA = mem[addr16]
	•	1010 STORE regA, addr16    ; mem[addr16] = regA
	•	1011 PUSH regA             ; push register
	•	1100 POP regA              ; pop register into regA
	•	1101 HALT

(This is tiny but expressive.)

Example assembly snippet

; compute 3 + 4 and halt
start:
    LOADI R0, 3
    LOADI R1, 4
    ADD   R0, R1
    HALT

You’ll define the exact binary encoding for each instruction (how immediates follow, endianness, etc.). Keep it simple: 16-bit words stored little-endian is fine.

⸻

Phase 3 — Write the emulator (3–7 days)

Purpose: run the machine code your assembler produces.

Minimal emulator tasks:
	1.	Represent CPU state: registers array, PC, SP, FLAGS.
	2.	Memory: allocate a bytearray (e.g., 64KB).
	3.	Fetch: read next instruction word at PC.
	4.	Decode: extract opcode and operands.
	5.	Execute: implement each opcode’s semantics (update PC, flags).
	6.	Stack handling for CALL/RET, and memory loads/stores.

Testing:
	•	Write unit tests for each instruction.
	•	Create small assembly programs: arithmetic, loops, function call, recursion.

Recommendation: implement in Python first (easy to read and debug). When working in Python, use struct to pack/unpack bytes.

⸻

Phase 4 — Write the assembler (3–7 days)

Assembler responsibilities:
	•	Lex/tokenize input.
	•	Parse labels, instructions, directives (e.g., .data, .word, .ascii).
	•	Two-pass approach:
	•	Pass 1: assign addresses to labels and record symbol table.
	•	Pass 2: translate instructions to binary, resolving labels to addresses.
	•	Emit output file: raw binary or a simple object file format (your own header + code + data).

Start simple: output a flat binary image (load address = 0x0000). Later implement relocations and object format.

Assembler features to add progressively:
	•	Numeric constants, expressions, arithmetic in immediate values.
	•	Local labels.
	•	.org, .align, .byte, .word, .ascii.
	•	Macro support (optional).

Pseudocode for pass 2 translation of LOADI R0, 3:
	•	Encode opcode bits 0010 in high nibble
	•	Encode target register bits into register fields
	•	Append immediate 16-bit little-endian to output

⸻

Phase 5 — Linker / object format (optional, next-level)

Once you want multiple source files and separate assembly modules:
	•	Design a minimal object file format (sections .text, .data, relocation entries, symbol table).
	•	Build a linker that:
	•	merges sections from object files,
	•	resolves symbol addresses,
	•	applies relocations,
	•	produces final binary image.
	•	Later: learn ELF (Unix) or Mach-O (macOS) formats to generate real executables.

If you want to avoid complexity at first: keep everything in one assembly file and a flat binary.

⸻

Phase 6 — Disassembler, debugger, and test harness (ongoing)
	•	Disassembler: prints instructions from binary → useful for debugging your assembler/emulator.
	•	Debugger: allow single-step, breakpoints, inspect registers and memory.
	•	Test suite: write many small programs with expected outputs and run them automatically against your emulator.

⸻

Phase 7 — Minimal compiler (7–14 days)

Goal: translate a tiny high-level language into your assembly:

Start with a tiny language subset:
	•	Arithmetic expressions, variables, if, while, function calls (no recursion to start).
	•	Implement a simple AST and a code generator that maps AST to assembly.
	•	Implement calling convention: which registers are caller-saved, where arguments go, how return value is passed, and stack frame layout.

Simple route:
	1.	Write a parser for expressions and statements.
	2.	Map a function to:
	•	push old registers,
	•	evaluate expressions into registers,
	•	CALL and RET.

This is the best way to see how compilers use your assembly.

⸻

Quick concrete examples (assembler & emulator ideas)

Minimal assembler workflow (two-pass)
	1.	Read lines; strip comments.
	2.	If label: record label → current address.
	3.	If instruction: estimate size (1 word + optional extra words) and increment current address.
	4.	After pass 1, perform pass 2 translating instructions to bytes, substituting label addresses.

Minimal emulator loop (Python pseudocode)

while True:
    instr = fetch_word(mem, PC)
    opcode = instr >> 12
    if opcode == 0xD:  # HALT
        break
    elif opcode == 0x2:  # LOADI
        regA = (instr >> 9) & 0x7
        imm = fetch_word(mem, PC+2)
        regs[regA] = imm
        PC += 4
    # ... handle others


⸻

Testing ideas / exercises (one-sentence each)
	•	Implement and test ADD/SUB with flag updates (zero, negative, carry).
	•	Implement a linked-list in assembly using LOAD/STORE.
	•	Implement printf-like syscall inside emulator (hook a memory-mapped I/O to print strings).
	•	Implement function calls and test recursion (e.g., factorial).
	•	Add interrupts or system calls later.

⸻

Recommended learning resources (books & free)
	•	Programming from the Ground Up (great intro assembling C-like problems into assembly)
	•	The Elements of Computing Systems (Nand2Tetris) — build a CPU and compiler from first principles
	•	Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective — for deeper systems understanding
	•	Various online CPU/ISA tutorials and blog posts (search by topic as you need them)

⸻

Suggested milestones & timeline (flexible)
	•	Week 0–1: Foundations + design ISA + simple assembly examples.
	•	Week 1–2: Implement Python emulator (NOP, LOADI, MOV, ADD, SUB, HALT).
	•	Week 2–3: Implement assembler (two-pass), assemble simple programs, run in emulator.
	•	Week 3–4: Add data directives, stack ops, CALL/RET, and write small libraries (I/O).
	•	Month 2: Implement linker/object model or simple compiler front-end generating your assembly.
	•	Month 3+: Port emulator to C/Rust, add debugger, learn ELF/Mach-O and produce native binaries or build LLVM backend.

Adjust pace to your schedule; each milestone yields immediate, testable artifacts.

⸻

Debugging tips & gotchas
	•	Start tiny and make one instruction work end-to-end (assembly → bytes → emulator).
	•	Keep good unit tests and automated regression tests.
	•	Use a hex-dump and disassembler to inspect binary output.
	•	For label/address bugs: print symbol table after pass 1.
	•	Watch out for endianness and alignment bugs.

⸻

If you want, next immediate steps (pick one and I’ll give code)
	1.	Implement the toy ISA above — I’ll generate a complete ISA spec and a runnable Python emulator.
	2.	Build a two-pass assembler in Python — I’ll provide starter code for tokenizer + pass structure.
	3.	Do both — assembler + emulator so you can assemble & run programs right away.
	4.	Design a different ISA (stack machine, 8-bit, 32-bit RISC-like) — I’ll help design it.

Tell me which of the four you want to start with and I’ll produce working, copy-pastable Python code (assembler or emulator or both) you can run immediately on your Mac. Ready when you are — and excited to build this with you. 🚀

Good question. You’re thinking like a systems person already 👍. Let’s unpack it:

⸻

Why Python first
	•	Speed of learning: You’ll spend 90% of your time reasoning about instruction formats, symbol tables, and execution semantics—not debugging segfaults. Python gets you to a working emulator/assembler in hours, so you can see programs run.
	•	Clarity: You can literally print out register states and memory at each step. That’s gold when you’re trying to understand how instructions actually behave.
	•	Iteration: You’ll change your ISA a lot at the start. Python makes it easy to update encodings, add/remove instructions, and test.
	•	Platform-neutral: Your MacBook is an ARM64 machine (M1/M2). Writing a real emulator in C/ASM ties you into tricky details (endianness, calling conventions, Mach-O linking). Python lets you skip OS headaches until you want them.

⸻

Why not lowest level right away?
	•	Bootstrapping problem: If you try to build your ISA directly in assembly/C on bare metal, you need a toolchain (assembler, linker, loader, debugger) before you can even run “hello world.” That’s months of upfront work.
	•	Mac specifics: Apple’s macOS uses Mach-O binaries, codesigning, and has limited access to bare-metal instructions. You’d be fighting the OS from day one.
	•	Pedagogy: The goal here isn’t to fight Apple security—it’s to understand how languages + ISAs work. Once your Python model is stable, you can translate it 1:1 into C, Rust, or even assembly.

⸻

The recommended sequence
	1.	Python emulator + assembler: validate your ISA, run toy programs, gain intuition.
	2.	C/Rust emulator: once the design is solid, port to a low-level language. This forces you to deal with pointers, memory safety, and performance.
	3.	Optional bare-metal: write your ISA for an FPGA (Verilog/VHDL) or use QEMU to boot a tiny OS with your ISA. That’s when you’re actually “writing assembly at the lowest level.”

⸻

So Python isn’t a cop-out—it’s your scaffolding. You will ditch it once the ISA works. It just keeps you from drowning in OS/ABI/toolchain details too early.

⸻

👉 Do you want me to give you:
	•	A ready-to-run Python skeleton emulator for the toy ISA (so you can run LOADI R0, 3; ADD R0, R1; HALT today)?
	•	Or would you prefer I show you how to start from C right away (slower, but closer to hardware)?

Which direction feels right to you?

Exactly 👍 — you nailed the progression. Let’s spell it out tier by tier so you can see the full ladder you’re climbing:

⸻

🪜 Stage 1: High-level emulator in Python
	•	Goal: Learn the concepts (ISA, instructions, memory, registers, assembler pipeline).
	•	Tool: Python.
	•	What you get: You can design your own toy assembly language, write programs in it, assemble → run → debug, all without fighting your OS.
	•	Analogy: Building a flight simulator on your laptop before you fly a real plane.

⸻

🪜 Stage 2: Lower-level emulator + assembler in C (or Rust)
	•	Goal: Implement it with full control over memory and performance.
	•	Tool: C (or Rust, if you prefer safety).
	•	What you get: Learn pointers, manual memory management, and CPU-like data handling. Your assembler outputs real binary files, and your emulator executes them much faster.
	•	Analogy: You’re still in a simulator, but now you’re flying with real cockpit controls instead of a video game joystick.

⸻

🪜 Stage 3: Hardware-level (FPGA or custom CPU)

Here’s where “lowest level” really means hardware.
Two main routes:
	1.	FPGA / HDL (Verilog or VHDL)
	•	You literally implement your toy ISA in digital logic.
	•	Run programs on a physical FPGA board (cheap ones exist, like TinyFPGA or DE10-Lite).
	•	This is how real CPUs are prototyped.
	•	Output: your toy assembly runs on actual silicon you programmed.
	2.	QEMU or LLVM backend
	•	Instead of hardware, you add your ISA to an emulator framework (like QEMU), or write a backend for LLVM so you can compile C into your ISA.
	•	This makes your “imaginary CPU” behave like a real platform that existing compilers can target.

⸻

🪜 Stage 4: Bare-metal programming
	•	Take a real existing CPU (like RISC-V or ARM) and write assembly without any operating system (directly to hardware).
	•	Boot a tiny kernel you wrote yourself, or flash it onto a Raspberry Pi / RISC-V dev board.
	•	This teaches you how real assembly interacts with hardware (I/O, interrupts, MMU, etc.).

⸻

🪜 Stage 5: Silicon design (ultimate low level)
	•	If you want to go all the way down: design a CPU at transistor-level (logic gates → ALU → control unit → ISA).
	•	That’s computer engineering territory, but it’s the bottom of the ladder.
	•	You can even fab a chip, though usually people stop at FPGA simulation.

⸻

🌍 Big picture
	•	Python → C → FPGA/HDL → Bare-metal on real CPU → Custom silicon
Each layer strips away abstraction until you’re literally flipping transistors.

⸻

Would you like me to map out the exact milestones for Stage 1 (Python ISA implementation) so you know what the first 2–3 weeks look like? That way you’ll have concrete goals before worrying about C and FPGA.
