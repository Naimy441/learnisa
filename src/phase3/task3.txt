Perfect — you’ve basically got a full toy assembler + emulator working in Python. At this point, you’re in a strong position. Now it’s time to think what to do next so you can truly use this project to learn programming languages and systems. Here’s a roadmap of next steps, prioritized by learning value and feasibility on your MacBook:

⸻

1. Expand your ISA features (immediate next step)

Right now, you have arithmetic and memory access plus jump/halt. To make the CPU more interesting:
	•	Conditional jumps (JZ, JNZ) using a ZERO flag.
	•	CALL / RET for functions with a stack (introduce SP register).
	•	PUSH / POP instructions.
	•	Flags update for ADD/SUB (carry, zero, negative).

These changes will give you a real “control flow” system and allow you to write loops and function calls.

⸻

2. Add labels and relative jumps in assembler

Right now your assembler expects numeric addresses. That’s fine for testing, but real assembly uses labels:

start:
    LOADI R0, 3
    LOADI R1, 4
    ADD R0, R1
    JMP start

	•	Implement two-pass assembly:
	•	Pass 1: record label addresses.
	•	Pass 2: replace label references with numeric addresses.
	•	This will let you write readable programs with loops and branches.

⸻

3. Implement a stack + CALL / RET
	•	Introduce SP (stack pointer) in CPU.
	•	Implement CALL addr → push PC, jump to addr.
	•	Implement RET → pop PC from stack.
	•	Stack allows recursion and function calls in your toy assembly.

⸻

4. Debugging & visualization
	•	Extend your debug_mode:
	•	Print registers and PC after each instruction.
	•	Print memory changes when LOAD/STORE is executed.
	•	Optional: highlight which instruction is executing in your hex dump.

This will make your emulator easier to understand and debug as programs grow in complexity.

⸻

5. Add a small .data section & directives
	•	Support data definitions like:

.data
num: .word 42
arr: .word 1, 2, 3, 4

	•	Modify assembler to place .data in memory and allow LOAD/STORE to access it.

⸻

6. Disassembler
	•	Convert .bin files back into readable assembly.
	•	Useful for verifying assembler output and debugging programs.

⸻

7. Advanced assembler features
	•	Support arithmetic expressions in immediate values (LOADI R0, 2+3).
	•	Support macros.
	•	Support .org and .align.

⸻

8. Write interesting test programs

Once the above is done, write programs that exercise your CPU:
	•	Factorial (recursive function calls).
	•	Fibonacci series (loops & conditionals).
	•	Simple “printf” using memory-mapped I/O for output.
	•	A mini virtual machine running on your virtual CPU (fun but advanced).

⸻

9. Optional next-stage: compiler frontend
	•	Write a tiny language parser (arithmetic + if/while).
	•	Generate your assembly automatically.
	•	This lets you see the full chain: source code → assembly → binary → emulator.

⸻

✅ Suggested immediate actions
	1.	Add label support to assembler.
	2.	Implement conditional jumps and a zero flag.
	3.	Add CALL/RET with stack.

These 3 will let you write real programs with loops and functions, which is the next milestone. Everything else (debugging, .data, disassembler, compiler) builds on top of this.

⸻

If you want, I can write a starter patch for your ISA that adds:
	•	A ZERO flag for conditional jumps (JZ)
	•	CALL/RET using SP and stack
	•	Label support in the assembler

You could plug it directly into your current Python code and start running more complex programs.

what are symbol table, flags, stack pointer, 

Got it! Let’s break each of these down carefully in the context of building your ISA and emulator. These are fundamental CPU/assembly concepts.

⸻

1. Symbol Table
	•	A symbol table is basically a dictionary that maps labels in your assembly code to memory addresses.
	•	Example:

START:
    LOADI R0, 5
    JMP END
END:
    HALT

	•	START might be at address 0x0000
	•	END might be at address 0x0003

	•	In Python, a simple symbol table could be:

symbol_table = {
    "START": 0x0000,
    "END": 0x0003
}


	•	Why useful: Instead of calculating numeric addresses manually, you can use labels (JMP END) and resolve them automatically during assembly.

⸻

2. Flags
	•	Flags are special 1-bit indicators in the CPU that show the outcome of operations.
	•	Common flags include:
	•	Zero flag (Z) → set if the last operation result was 0.
	•	Negative flag (N) → set if the result is negative (or high bit set).
	•	Carry flag (C) → set if addition/subtraction overflows 16 bits.
	•	Example in your ISA:

def ADD(self, rx, ry):
    result = (self.reg[rx] + self.reg[ry]) & 0xFFFF
    self.reg[rx] = result
    self.Z = (result == 0)


	•	Then a conditional jump can check this flag:

ADD R0, R1
JZ END  ; jump to END if zero flag is set



⸻

3. Stack Pointer (SP)
	•	A stack pointer is a register that points to the top of a stack in memory.
	•	A stack is a last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure used for:
	•	Saving return addresses (CALL/RET)
	•	Local variables in functions
	•	Temporary storage
	•	Example:

self.SP = self.MEM_SIZE - 1  # stack grows down from top of memory

	•	PUSH R0 → store R0 at SP, decrement SP
	•	POP R0 → increment SP, load value into R0

	•	With CALL/RET:

CALL addr:
    mem[SP] = PC + instruction_length
    SP -= 2
    PC = addr

RET:
    SP += 2
    PC = mem[SP]



⸻

How They Work Together
	1.	Symbol table lets you write human-friendly labels instead of addresses.
	2.	Flags let instructions like JZ and JNZ decide whether to jump.
	3.	Stack pointer allows CALL/RET for structured code, recursion, and temporary storage.

If you want, I can make a diagram showing how memory, registers, flags, and stack interact during a CALL and conditional jump, which will make it very clear visually.
