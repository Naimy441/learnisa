Exactly — for bootstrapping, the first thing you need is an assembler written in your toy assembly, because that’s what will let you eventually compile everything without Python.

Here’s how your notes would adapt for an assembler in assembly:

⸻

1️⃣ CMD
	•	Take a file path for an assembly source file instead of C.

⸻

2️⃣ READ
	•	Load the assembly text file into memory.

⸻

3️⃣ LEXER
	•	Go through every character in the assembly file.
	•	Identify:
	•	Opcodes (LOAD, ADD, STORE, etc.)
	•	Registers (R0, R1, etc.)
	•	Immediate values / addresses
	•	Delimiters (;, line breaks)
	•	Store token types and values contiguously in memory.

⸻

4️⃣ PARSER
	•	Parse the token stream into a structured form.
	•	For assembly, this is simpler than C:
	•	Each instruction is essentially a node with opcode + operands.
	•	Build an instruction table / AST-like structure in memory.

⸻

5️⃣ CODE GENERATOR / BINARY
	•	Convert each parsed instruction into machine code directly.
	•	Map:
	•	Opcode → binary opcode
	•	Register → register bits
	•	Immediate/address → bytes
	•	Place the resulting bytes into memory or output buffer.

⸻

6️⃣ WRITE
	•	Write the machine code to a .bin file.
	•	This is the key difference from a C compiler:
	•	No need to generate assembly from AST.
	•	AST-like structure is directly mapped to binary.

⸻

✅ Key differences from a C compiler

Step	C Compiler	Assembler in Assembly
Input	C source code	Assembly source code
Lexer	Identify keywords, identifiers, literals	Identify opcodes, registers, numbers
Parser	Build AST	Build instruction table / minimal AST
Codegen	AST → ISA assembly	AST/instruction table → machine code
Binary	Encode assembly → binary	Encode instruction → binary directly
Output	.bin executable	.bin executable


⸻

So, in short: for the assembler, you skip generating assembly; the AST/instruction table goes straight to binary.

If you want, I can sketch a memory layout for the assembler, showing how it reads source → tokens → instruction table → binary buffer, which makes implementing it in assembly much easier. Do you want me to do that?
