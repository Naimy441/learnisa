Exactly — for bootstrapping, the first thing you need is an assembler written in your toy assembly, because that’s what will let you eventually compile everything without Python.

Here’s how your notes would adapt for an assembler in assembly:

⸻

1️⃣ CMD
	•	Take a file path for an assembly source file instead of C.

⸻

2️⃣ READ
	•	Load the assembly text file into memory.

⸻

3️⃣ LEXER
	•	Go through every character in the assembly file.
	•	Identify:
	•	Opcodes (LOAD, ADD, STORE, etc.)
	•	Registers (R0, R1, etc.)
	•	Immediate values / addresses
	•	Delimiters (;, line breaks)
	•	Store token types and values contiguously in memory.

⸻

4️⃣ PARSER
	•	Parse the token stream into a structured form.
	•	For assembly, this is simpler than C:
	•	Each instruction is essentially a node with opcode + operands.
	•	Build an instruction table / AST-like structure in memory.

⸻

5️⃣ CODE GENERATOR / BINARY
	•	Convert each parsed instruction into machine code directly.
	•	Map:
	•	Opcode → binary opcode
	•	Register → register bits
	•	Immediate/address → bytes
	•	Place the resulting bytes into memory or output buffer.

⸻

6️⃣ WRITE
	•	Write the machine code to a .bin file.
	•	This is the key difference from a C compiler:
	•	No need to generate assembly from AST.
	•	AST-like structure is directly mapped to binary.

⸻

✅ Key differences from a C compiler

Step	C Compiler	Assembler in Assembly
Input	C source code	Assembly source code
Lexer	Identify keywords, identifiers, literals	Identify opcodes, registers, numbers
Parser	Build AST	Build instruction table / minimal AST
Codegen	AST → ISA assembly	AST/instruction table → machine code
Binary	Encode assembly → binary	Encode instruction → binary directly
Output	.bin executable	.bin executable


⸻

So, in short: for the assembler, you skip generating assembly; the AST/instruction table goes straight to binary.

If you want, I can sketch a memory layout for the assembler, showing how it reads source → tokens → instruction table → binary buffer, which makes implementing it in assembly much easier. Do you want me to do that?

i have to compare a lot of strings in assembly, problem is that i keep rewriting the same function with different registers because sometimes registers are needed somewhere and not elsewhere, is the common solution to store variables on the stack? and then "call" with a function and RET

Yes — what you’re describing is exactly why most assembly programmers use the stack and function calls instead of rewriting the same code for different registers. Here’s the typical approach:
	1.	Store variables on the stack if they can’t all fit in registers. This allows your function to access them consistently, no matter what registers are free in the caller.
	•	Example (x86-ish pseudo-assembly):

push eax        ; save caller's value
push ebx
mov eax, [esp+offset]  ; load local variable


	2.	Write a single function for your string comparison that uses specific registers internally.
	•	It doesn’t matter which registers the caller uses, because you can push any registers you overwrite at the start and pop them at the end.
	3.	Call and RET:
	•	Caller sets up arguments (usually on stack or in registers, depending on your convention).
	•	Call your function.
	•	Function does its work, returns, and cleans up.

Example pattern for a string compare function:

str_cmp:
    push eax        ; save used registers
    push ecx
    ; ... do comparison using eax, ecx, etc.
    pop ecx         ; restore
    pop eax
    ret

Benefits:
	•	You write the comparison logic once.
	•	You don’t worry about which registers are available in the caller.
	•	Easier to maintain and extend.

💡 Tip: Use a calling convention (like cdecl or stdcall) to standardize which registers are preserved and where arguments go. This makes your life much easier when your program grows.

If you want, I can sketch a full reusable string compare function using the stack and call/ret that works for arbitrary register usage. Do you want me to do that?

Trying to manually track which registers are free is a nightmare as soon as your program grows. Even a small string comparison function can require several registers, and if the caller also needs them, you’ll end up constantly rewriting code or chasing bugs.

With a stack-based function:
	•	You can always use the registers you need inside the function because you save/restore the caller’s values.
	•	Your functions become modular and reusable.
	•	It’s much easier to maintain and extend your program.
